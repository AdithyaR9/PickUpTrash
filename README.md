Note: This program uses the JavaFX library, make sure it is downloaded and linked to your IDE properly for the program to function. 

This is a JavaFX game, which is drawn to and played on a new window on the screen, in which a grid of empy and filled in boxes are displayed. The filled in black boxes represent trash, and it is the user's job to pick up all the trash by clicking on them. The game is over when all the trash has been picked up. 
      - When trash is picked up all infinitely adjacent trash is also picked up. 
      
*I created this to familiarize myself with the JavaFx library and the classes within it. I wanted to apply what I had learned on painting to the screen on seperate windows, and to have the program react to user input, such as through the mouse or keyboard.
